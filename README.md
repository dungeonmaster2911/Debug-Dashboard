Overview

--> The goal was to provide the user with customisable buttons to execute the desired commands via ADB (Android Debug Bridge), Serial Port, Sytem commands etc.

--> The button settings are imported via JSON file.

--> The tool also provides the option to capture logs via ADB / Serial Ports.

--> This was developed as a hobby project while my time at HARMAN, with the goal to increase the team's efficieny while debugging on Automotive hardware.
